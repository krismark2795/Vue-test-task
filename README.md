-- What I have done in this test task --

In this test task, I used Vue2(options API).
I was thinking of using Vuex for state management system, but no need at all for this task.
I hardcoded the API data without using axios library.

-- Some inappropriate features in this project. --
As I built the application based on the project I used in the past, there are unncessary node modules in the current project, so they need to be removed.
